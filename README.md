# System Design

## System Architecture

We will develop a 3-tier application comprising the presentation, application, and data tiers. 

In the presentation tier, an Android application will be crafted using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. 

The backend, representing the application tier, will be hosted on Amazon EC2. The typical User API will mainly utilize Django, and machine learning classification will be powered by the Huggingface library and Pytorch. We will also utilize Kakao API as an external API for searching restaurants and crawling data for tag classification of posts.

For the data tier, we will use RDS with MySQL. Since users will upload images, AWS S3 will also be integrated.

## Class Diagrams and Data Models

### Data Model

![data_model](https://github.com/snuhcs-course/swpp-2023-project-team-15/assets/19504579/e0fc37c4-8987-4173-970d-58f429d37b12)

The following diagram illustrates an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) outlining the Django models for our service. Each box corresponds to an individual model and delineates its associated fields. The arrows signify the relationships between the models, capturing the intricate connections within our system.

This database schema represents a system for managing user-generated content related to restaurant experiences. Users can create posts about restaurants, with each post linked to a specific user and restaurant. Users can also establish relationships by following or being followed by other users. Additionally, users can get user tags identified through preference analysis AI, and posts can include multiple photos. The schema also includes a mechanism for users to like posts, creating a many-to-many relationship between users and posts.


### Frontend Class Diagram

![FrontEnd Class Diagram](https://github.com/snuhcs-course/swpp-2023-project-team-15/assets/19504579/b1e98234-607d-4ef3-adbc-fcabc19b3abe)

The frontend class diagram consists of mainly three kind of classes. 
- Activities: There are two activities in our app, which are `StartActivity` and `AppMainActivity`. `StartActivity` is the first screen that users see when they open the app. It is responsible for showing the splash screen and redirecting to the login screen. `AppMainActivity` is the main screen of the app. It is responsible for showing the bottom navigation bar and switching between different screens.
- View Models: There are two view models in our app, which are `AppMainViewModel` and `StartViewModel`, each corresponding to the activity of the same name. These view models are responsible for handling the business logic of the corresponding activity.
- Repository: There is one single `ApiRepository` class in our app. This class is responsible for handling all the API calls to the backend server.
- Composables: There are various composables responsible for rendering different screens,and are marked with `@Composable` in our class diagram. These composables are used in the corresponding activity's layout.


### Backend Class Diagram
![BackEnd Class Diagram](https://github.com/snuhcs-course/swpp-2023-project-team-15/assets/19504579/d767a7ef-27b5-480d-b040-5cc9fea5cd2f)

The backend class diagram consists of mainly three parts, which are `posts`, `tags`, `users`. These parts represents three internal apps of Django, each consisting several relevant model classes.

- App `posts` contains `Post`, `PostPhotos`, `Restaurant` models.
- App `tags` contains `Tag` models.
- App `users` contains `User`, `Follow` models.

These models are connected with each other through foreign key relationships. For example, `Post` model has a foreign key to `Restaurant` model, and `PostPhotos` model has a foreign key to `Post` model. These relations are represented as arrows in the diagram.

# Testing Plan

## Unit Testing & Integration Testing

### Android App [ Frontend ]

For android app, we are using JUnit 4 for unit testing and integration testing. Additionally, we are using mockk for mocking objects and coroutines for asynchronous testing. 
We are focusing on testing the business logic of the app, which is mainly implemented in the ViewModel. Integration tests are also performed to check interactions between ViewModels and the Repository, ensuring correct API communication with the backend and proper data flow throughout the app.

### Django App [ Backend ]

For Django app, we are using unit test library and django testing library for API testing. We have 80% of code coverage over important code, excluding migration files. We are excluding migration files because they are automatically generated by Django and are not part of our codebase. Especially for all views.py, models.py files, we accomplished more coverage than 75%.

### Test Coverage Report 

| As shown below in Figure 1 we tested `13` methods for StartViewModel in start package & `50` methods for AppMainViewModel in appmain package.

<img width="1427" alt="overall_white" src="https://github.com/snuhcs-course/swpp-2023-project-team-15/assets/144414644/29d04e3e-403f-400e-8e48-6aad08d7a5e6">

**Figure1. Overall Coverage Report**

| As shown below in Figure 2 & 3 , we covered `92.9%` for StartViewModel & `89.6%` for AppMainViewModel.

<img width="1426" alt="start_white" src="https://github.com/snuhcs-course/swpp-2023-project-team-15/assets/144414644/47ceb9b8-a495-4876-9761-ca02898672d9">

**Figure2. StartViewModel Coverage Report**




<img width="1427" alt="appmain_white" src="https://github.com/snuhcs-course/swpp-2023-project-team-15/assets/144414644/0926535f-7101-4487-af0a-511c9aa7d968">

**Figure3. AppMainViewModel Coverage Report**




We used Jetpack’s Composable functions across all ScreenKt Classes. Composables are a modern toolkit for building native UIs in Android. They don't need a unit test for the following reasons.
 * Composables are declarative which is they describe what the UI should look like for a given state, rather than detailing the steps to construct the UI.
 * Composables are side-effect-free and only responsible for UI rendering based on the inputs they receive.
 

Therefore, they **don't** contain logic that needs to be verified through unit tests. 


So, we replaced them through an integration test that verifies the interaction between different parts of our app using Compose Testing Library. It is shown below in Figure4.

**Figure5. Backend Test Coverage Report**



## Acceptance Testing  

We plan to test 5 user stories for User Acceptance Testing. This stories are also listed in Requirements & Specifications.

1. As a user, I want to search for other users by their usernames or user tags, so I can connect with people who share similar food tastes with me.
2. As a user, I want to write and post reviews for restaurants, including details like the restaurant's name, photos, ratings, and comments, so I can share my dining experiences with others.
3. As a user, I want to receive personalized tags at my profile based on my previous reviews, so my profile appropriately represents my food tastes.
4. As a user, I want to record my dining history by reviews and view those of others' that I liked, so that I can revisit and go down my memory lane.
5. As a user, I want to follow other users that has similar tastes with me, so I can keep up with their reviews at home feed.

## ML Accuracy Testing
- **Dataset**: Reviews from Naver, Kakao, generated by ChatGPT, and personal reviews (Total: 40)
- **Objective**: Heuristically select appropriate atmosphere tags for each review (choose two in ambiguous cases).
- **Success Criteria**: Test passes if the selected tag appears in the review.

### First Testing Phase
- **Total Reviews Tested**: 27
- **Failures**: 6
  - **Issue**: The tag 'friendly service' was too generic and applied to many reviews.
  - **Solution**: Modified the tag to 'excellent staff service' and lowered the score threshold from 0.3 to 0.23.
  
### Second Testing Phase
- **Total Reviews Retested**: 27
- **Failures**: 1
  - **Improvement**: Significant decrease in failures post-adjustments.

### Additional Testing
- **New Total Reviews Tested**: 40
- **Failures**: 2
  - **Result**: Majority (38/40) passed, indicating successful tag application and improved algorithm performance.

**Conclusion**: The adjustments to the tag and score threshold resulted in more accurate and relevant tag application in the reviews.
